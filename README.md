# Workshop Module Federation

This project provides resources for a Module Federation workshop.

The presentation support is deployed [here](https://ddecrulle.github.io/workshop-module-federation/), the sources are available on the `slides` branch and the [pdf](https://github.com/ddecrulle/workshop-module-federation/blob/gh-pages/slides.pdf) and [pptx](https://github.com/ddecrulle/workshop-module-federation/blob/gh-pages/slides.pdf) exports on the gh-pages branch.

The `main` branch offers a starter for the workshop.
